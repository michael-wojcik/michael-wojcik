## Web dev. Drupal pro. Aspiring JavaScript geek.

Hi! I'm a Senior Developer at Last Call Media. Previously, I was a Senior Developer at Hook 42 and a Drupal Developer at Elevated Third and Mediacurrent. I'm also an Acquia Certified Developerâ€”in Drupal 8 as of 2018 and in Drupal 7 as of 2016.

Prior to that, I also worked as the website administrator for multiple research institutes and initiatives at Duke University. My other past work includes freelance web development and consulting with a focus on Drupal and WordPress websites.

Professionally speaking, I'm a Philosophy/German undergrad major turned Computer Science/Web Development geek.
